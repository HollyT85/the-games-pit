### *Design Choices*

#### Font

The logo for The Games Pit has always had an old-fashioned look which the shop owner wished to keep. As such, I have used [Uncial Antiqua](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Uncial+Antiqua?query=uncial).

#### Colours

The shop owner wanted the colours to be related to the zombie logo. The initial colour choice worked around the green of the zombie however, this was soon realised to not be very attractive and we changed it to blue. The colours are directly picked from the zombie's t-shirt. The inital blue was too dark to read against the dark background so this was changed to a paler blue which received better feedback.

#### Shop & Shop Front

There is a shop front which matches the style of other online gaming shops with banners on the home page which link to all products in their respective category. Each page provides access to the user's bag, their profile, a search bar and an easily navigable nav-bar.

Users can navitage the site and easily choose the products they want to purchase.
